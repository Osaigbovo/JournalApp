# JournalApp

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Andela-Google-Udacity Android Developer Scholarship. 
This app reveals the power of Firebase, Dagger, and adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.

# Features
With the app, you can:

Write down how you day went, putting donw precious thought to a secure archive.
Modify and delete your journal entries.
See the date you filled in an entry.
This app requires a Gmail account for login.
